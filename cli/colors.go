Please use this guide to visualize what each color code maps to which colors.
Remember, white and black (or any other color for that matter) may not show up
depending on the color settings of your terminal. Color codes are wrapped in
braces to provide them a simple yet easily distinguishable format. Bracketed
text that doesn't match a color code will not be replaced, but if you want to
display a color code the preced the opening brace with a \, like \\{b}.

 \{L} {L}black{x} \{R} {R}red{x} \{G} {G}green{x} \{Y} {Y}yellow{x} \{B} {B}blue{x} \{M} {M}magenta{x} \{C} {C}cyan{x} \{W} {W}white{x}
 \{l} {l}black{x} \{r} {r}red{x} \{g} {g}green{x} \{y} {y}yellow{x} \{b} {b}blue{x} \{m} {m}magenta{x} \{c} {c}cyan{x} \{w} {w}white{x}

If you plan to transition for bright (uppercase codes) to dark (lowercase codes)
you have to reset between. The best way to achieve this to group your reset
(metioned below) and dark color. For example going from \{R} to \{c} you might
do {R}\{R}this is bright red {x,c}\{x,c}this is dark cyan{x}. Note the reset occurs first,
this is important otherwise you'll reset the code you just set.

If you would prefer to highlight the background, then simply add a '-' before
the code (inside of the braces). For example: \{l,-Y} {l,-Y}Hello, World!{x}. Notice
that color specifications can have a comma seperating color values. This is
really only for specyfing a foreground/background color simultaneously as there
is an issue with the Regular Expressions that break back to back codes (like
\{l}\{-Y} would fail to match both, and just produce black text.

Another special code is \{u} which {u}underlines{x} text. It's important to remember to
include \{x} after you underline text otherwise all text following will be
underlined.

It's best practice to end colored lines or sections with \{x} which is a special
code used to reset the foreground and background colors. If you don't do this
colors will bleed across lines.
